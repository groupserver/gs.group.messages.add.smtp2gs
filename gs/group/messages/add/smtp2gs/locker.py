    '''Get a file-lock, breaking the lock if it has been held for too long.

:return: A lock, which may be locked. Use the

It is more than possible for Postfix to consume every single thread on the
sever. By adding a lock, with a short timeout, we slow down the consumption of
threads by the asynchronous email UI; this allows the Web UI to be responsive.

We break the lock if the lock is very old because it is more than possible for
something to crash with the lock taken. (It does assume that no email will
take more than :const:`BREAK_LOCK_AGE` to process.)

If the file is still locked, after we wait for something to finish and check
that the lock is not too old, then we exit. Postfix will try running the
script with the same arguments again later.

**Example**::

    from gs.group.messsages.add.smtp2gs import locker
    lock = locker.get_lock()
    if lock.i_am_locking():
        # Do stuff.
'''
