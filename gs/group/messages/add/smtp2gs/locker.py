    # The reason this locking is here is that it is more than possible for
    # Postfix to consume every single thread on the sever. By adding a
    # lock, with a short timeout, we slow down the consumption of threads
    # by the asynchronous email UI; this prevents the Web UI (which needs
    # to be responsive) from locking up.
    #
    # We break the lock if the lock is very old because it is more than
    # possible for something to crash with the lock taken. (It does assume
    # that no email will take more than BREAK_LOCK_AGE to process.)
    #
    # If the file is still locked, after we wait for something to finish
    # and check that the lock is not too old, then we exit. Postfix will
    # try running the script with the same arguments again later.
